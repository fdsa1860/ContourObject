% then we can create a directed, acyclic grpah and solve the problem
% exactly.  If nb_loops>1, then we take a greedy approach by taking the
% longest path around, removing the nodes we've visited and continuing.  If
% a contour actually takes multiple loops, then it should be a reasonable
% assumption that each loop's longest path will use different nodes.
